- What is Git?

Git is a version control system that helps you track changes in your code or files over time.
Imagine it as a timeline where you can save snapshots (called commits) of your project at different stages.
If you mess up or want to revisit an earlier version, Git allows you to go back in time easily.

- What is GitHub?
Github is a platform where you can store your Git repositories online (in the cloud).

Think of it as a social network for developers and their code:

You can upload your code (repository)..

Share it with others.

Work with your tean on the same project from anywhere.
